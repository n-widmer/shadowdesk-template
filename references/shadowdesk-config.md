# ShadowDesk — Skill Settings

This is the one place the config-driven ShadowDesk skills read their per-user settings.
Fill in the values for your tools and the skills adapt to you. Each skill reads ONLY its own `##` section.
Anything you leave blank or as a `[placeholder]` falls back to safe, generic behavior, and the skill
will tell you, once, what to fill in. So you can start using everything today and tune this over time.

Format: plain `- key: value` lines under each skill heading. Keep the keys exactly as written.
This file lives in YOUR repo and is never shared. Edit it by hand any time.

- selfEmail: [your-email]           # added as a guest so the Yes/No/Maybe RSVP prompt shows
