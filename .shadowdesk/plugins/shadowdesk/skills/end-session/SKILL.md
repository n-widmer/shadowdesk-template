name: end-session
description: Run the session-closing ritual for your repo. Detects what changed in the session (git + conversation), updates folder CLAUDE.md files with status/next-steps/blockers, drafts new memory entries (user/feedback/project/reference) using the root CLAUDE.md memory rules, runs the memory conveyor automatically to keep the index under its load budget (ages overflow into a dated archive, never deletes, no prompt), writes a RESUME briefing for the next session, closes out with a plain-English receipt of what the whole session accomplished and what got filed where, and commits + pushes so the next session has full context. ALWAYS invoke when the user says any of "stopping for the day", "wrapping up", "ending session", "done for the day", "calling it", "calling it a day", "taking a break", "logging off", "finished for now", or types /end-session directly. Also invoke when the user says they are about to step away or the session feels like it is wrapping up.

# /end-session

*Provided as part of your ShadowDesk engagement. Not for resale or redistribution.*

You are running the session-closing ritual for the user's repo. The goal: the next session picks up with full context — no drift, no rot, no cold start.

## Step 0 — load your settings

Before anything else, read your per-user settings so this skill adapts to whoever is running it. Use the Read tool on `references/shadowdesk-config.md` (a path relative to the repo root — the session's working directory IS the repo root, so read it as `references/shadowdesk-config.md`).

Find the `## end-session` section and parse its `- key: value` lines. The keys this skill uses:

- **registries** — comma-separated list of root-level registry files to refresh in Phase 3.5 (example: `SKILLS.md, CONNECTIONS.md, TIME-SAVED.md`).
- **registryPreserveSections** — comma-separated list of hand-maintained `## ` section headings inside `SKILLS.md` that must be preserved, never regenerated (example: `## Plugins & platform tools, ## Removed / status`).
- **knowledgeGraph** — the in-repo knowledge-graph folder path for the Phase 3 knowledge-layer step (example: `knowledge/`).
- **conveyorScript** — the memory-conveyor script path run in Phase 4 (example: `scripts/memory-conveyor.mjs`). If this script doesn't exist on disk, skip the conveyor call and use the manual hygiene fallback noted in Phase 4.
- **folderLayoutDoc** — the folder-layout map updated in Phase 3 when top-level folders change (example: `references/operating/folder-layout.md`).
- **memoryIndexFormat** — how the memory index is shaped in Phase 3/4 (example: `pin-band` — a `[PIN]` band at the top, fresh entries newest-first below).

Throughout the phases below, wherever it says "the `<key>` from your settings," use the value you parsed here.

**If the file or the `## end-session` section is missing:** tell the user in one plain line to create `references/shadowdesk-config.md` with an `## end-session` section (you may scaffold a starter from the keys above), then continue with safe generic fallbacks: `registries` → none (skip Phase 3.5 registry refresh), `registryPreserveSections` → preserve any `## ` section that isn't a per-skill block, `knowledgeGraph` → skip the knowledge-layer step, `conveyorScript` → use the manual hygiene fallback in Phase 4, `folderLayoutDoc` → skip the folder-map update, `memoryIndexFormat` → a plain newest-first index.

The **memory folder path and the default git branch are NOT in config** — they are auto-discovered at runtime in Phase 0 below. That discovery is the source of truth; never hardcode either one.

## Phase 0: Locate the moving parts (runtime discovery)

Before the change-detection in Phase 1, discover the two locations this skill depends on. Do NOT hardcode them.

**The default branch.** Detect it, don't assume `main`. Try `git symbolic-ref --quiet --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (strip the `origin/` prefix); if that's empty, fall back to the branch `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` reports, or `git remote show origin` and read "HEAD branch." Use the detected branch everywhere this skill says "the default branch" (Phase 2 ahead/behind check, Phase 7 push).

**The auto-memory folder.** Claude Code keeps per-project auto-memory under the user's home `.claude/projects/` tree. Find this project's folder by matching the working directory to its slug:

1. List the projects parent. On macOS it is `~/.claude/projects/` (`$HOME/.claude/projects`). On Windows it is `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\projects\` (`$HOME` also resolves to this under Git Bash/MSYS).
2. Compute this project's slug from the repo root path: take the absolute working-directory path, drop the drive-letter colon if present, and replace every `/` and `\` with `-`. Example: a repo at `/Users/someone/myrepo` becomes `-Users-someone-myrepo`; a Windows repo at `C:/Users/someone/projects/myrepo` becomes `c--Users-someone-projects-myrepo`. Slugs are case-sensitive on disk, so if no exact match is found, match case-insensitively.
3. The matched subfolder is this project's auto-memory home. The index is `<that subfolder>/memory/MEMORY.md`; individual entries are sibling `*.md` files in the same `memory/` folder.
4. If no matching subfolder or no `memory/MEMORY.md` exists, this repo has no auto-memory yet — skip the memory steps (Phase 3 memory drafting, Phase 4 conveyor) and note it once in the close-out. Don't create one unprompted.

Hold the discovered default branch and memory path in your working context for the rest of the run.

## Mental model

You are the user's **secretary for their second brain**, and the second brain is the operational backbone of their business — so this close-out is the job that keeps the whole thing from drifting. Take meticulous notes on what the session covered, file every durable fact in its correct home (the right folder CLAUDE.md, memory, the knowledge graph, the registries), and leave the desk clean so tomorrow opens with full context and nothing lost. The user has spelled out their organizational rules in the root CLAUDE.md and in their auto-memory system; apply those rules without making them repeat themselves. If you're tempted to ask "what did we work on?" — re-read the transcript and the diff instead. That's the whole point of this skill.

Brief the user the way a good secretary briefs a CEO: plain English, no jargon, lead with what happened. That voice lands hardest in the Phase 8 close-out receipt, but keep it in every gate and prompt along the way too.

**Nothing in this skill is destructive, so nothing needs a confirmation gate.** Memory hygiene is now a one-command automatic conveyor (Phase 4) that only ever MOVES overflow notes into a dated archive — it never deletes. The only thing that ever stops the run is a hard failure (a conservation check, a push conflict), surfaced as one plain line, not a choice.

**AskUserQuestion discipline.** On the rare occasion you must present a real choice (a push conflict, a genuine ambiguity), it goes through the AskUserQuestion tool, never free-text "pick A/B/C." Always include a "(Recommended)" option as the FIRST item, with a smart pick (one you'd actually defend, not "first option safest").

## Phase 1: Detect what changed

Run these in parallel:

- `git status` and `git diff` — current uncommitted changes
- `git log <last-commit>..HEAD` where `<last-commit>` comes from `.claude/.session-state.json` if it exists; if the file doesn't exist or this is the first run, default to `git log --since="24 hours ago"`
- `git rev-parse HEAD` — capture the current HEAD hash at the START of this skill run (you'll write it to the sentinel in Phase 6)
- `hostname` — capture the current machine name (for sentinel + RESUME briefing)
- Read `.claude/.session-state.json` if it exists, to find the last run's metadata
- Read the `MEMORY.md` at the memory path you discovered in Phase 0 — needed for dedup (Phase 3); the conveyor (Phase 4) handles sizing
- Get the current local time: `date '+%m/%-d/%y - %H:%M %Z'` (per the root CLAUDE.md timezone rule — do NOT use `TZ='America/New_York'` or any TZ override on Windows/MSYS2, it silently returns GMT instead of local time)

Build a working map (in your head, no temp file):

- **touched_files**: every file changed since the last run (uncommitted + committed-since-sentinel)
- **touched_folders**: for each touched file, the closest CLAUDE.md ancestor (walk up the tree)
- **per_folder_summary**: per touched folder, what changed and why (synthesize from conversation + diff, NOT just the diff — the conversation has the *why*)
- **candidate_memories**: things learned this session that pass the memory-write classifier (Phase 3)

If `--dry-run` flag was passed: do all detection + classification, log what you would write, then stop. Write nothing. Useful for checking the skill before letting it run for real.

## Phase 2: Fetch and pull only if behind

Run `git fetch origin`, then `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/<default-branch>` to check ahead/behind status (use the branch you detected in Phase 0).

- If 0 behind (local is in sync or ahead): skip the pull entirely. No-op.
- If behind AND working tree is clean: `git pull --rebase`.
- If behind AND working tree has unstaged changes: `git stash push -u -m "/end-session auto-stash"`, then `git pull --rebase`, then `git stash pop`. If pop conflicts, halt and surface.
- If pull or stash-pop surfaces a conflict: halt, surface the exact conflict, AskUserQuestion how to proceed. Options: "Resolve manually now (Recommended)" / "Abort the /end-session run / Try a different strategy." Never auto-resolve.

Why this matters: an unconditional `git pull --rebase` errors out the moment there are any unstaged changes, which there almost always are during a session. Fetching first and gating on actual divergence avoids the failure mode entirely.

## Phase 3: Write to CLAUDE.md files + draft memory entries

### Folder CLAUDE.md updates

For each entry in `touched_folders`, update that folder's `CLAUDE.md` under a `## Recent sessions` heading (create the section if it doesn't exist). Newest at top:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD - HH:MM <tz>
**Status:** <one line>
**Done this session:** <bullets>
**Next steps:** <bullets>
**Blockers:** <bullets, or "none">
```

Use the local time you captured in Phase 1.

If new top-level folders were created since the last run, also update the folder tree in the **folderLayoutDoc from your settings**. The tree lives there now, NOT in root CLAUDE.md — CLAUDE.md is the lean behavioral spine and only points to the folder-layout doc. If no folderLayoutDoc is configured, skip the folder-map update.

### Memory entries — the 7-step classifier

For every "thing learned this session" (extracted from the conversation, not the diff), apply this classifier. The rules come from the root CLAUDE.md auto-memory section — apply them verbatim, don't reinvent:

1. **Derivable from code or git history alone?** → Skip. Don't write. *(This includes prior `chore(session):` commits made by `/end-session` itself — those are pure git-history bookkeeping and should never be re-processed.)*
2. **Status / next-step / blocker for a specific project?** → Already covered in folder CLAUDE.md (above). Don't duplicate to memory.
3. **User identity / role / preference?** → Memory, type=`user`.
4. **Correction or validated approach?** → Memory, type=`feedback`. MUST include `**Why:**` and `**How to apply:**` lines per the format spec.
5. **Project state not derivable from code (deadline, stakeholder ask, in-flight initiative)?** → Memory, type=`project`. Include Why + How to apply.
6. **Pointer to external system (Linear, Slack, dashboard)?** → Memory, type=`reference`.
7. **About this in-progress task only?** → Skip memory. It goes in the RESUME briefing instead (Phase 5).

### Dedup before write

Before writing any new memory entry, fuzzy-match the topic against existing MEMORY.md entries. **High topical overlap → update the existing entry** instead of adding a new one. This is the single most important rule for fighting memory rot — most of MEMORY.md's bloat is variations on the same theme accumulating instead of merging.

**One line in. Decide the pin at birth.** Every index entry you write is a SINGLE line — a `## ` heading that ends with a pointer to its topic file. No second line, no paragraph. Detail lives in the topic file, never inline in the index — if you catch yourself writing a second sentence into the index, stop and put it in the topic file. Engineering / commit-by-commit detail is git-derivable (classifier rule 1) and never enters memory at all; it lives in the project folder.

Decide PINNED-or-not as you write it (don't defer — deferring is what creates large unwieldy memory piles):
- **Pin it** (`## [PIN] …`) if it's a durable hard-rule / security / voice convention NOT already in the root CLAUDE.md, an active client, or an in-flight project. Pins never age out of the loaded index.
- **Leave it fresh** (no marker) for everything else — recent learnings, gotchas, references. Fresh entries ride the conveyor newest-first and age out into the archive when the budget fills. This is the default.

The conveyor (Phase 4) normalizes format and sizing automatically, so getting the line shape exactly right matters less than getting the pin decision and the dedup right.

### Memory file format

For each new memory entry, write a file in the memory folder you discovered in Phase 0:
`<memory-folder>/<type>_<topic-slug>_<MM_DD_YY>.md`

```markdown
---
name: <short-kebab-case-slug>
description: <one-line description used to decide relevance in future conversations — be specific>
metadata:
  node_type: memory
  type: <user|feedback|project|reference>
---

<For feedback/project: lead with the rule/fact, then **Why:** and **How to apply:** lines.>
<For user/reference: just the content, well-organized.>
```

Then add a SINGLE pointer line to MEMORY.md (the index, at the same path), shaped by the **memoryIndexFormat from your settings**. For the `pin-band` format: the index has a `[PIN]` band at the very top (after the `# Auto Memory` header + the one-line conveyor note), then the fresh entries newest-first — insert a fresh entry at the top of the fresh band; insert a pin at the top of the `[PIN]` band. (If memoryIndexFormat is a plain newest-first index instead, just insert every new entry at the top under the `# Auto Memory` header.)

```markdown
## <[PIN] if pinned> <headline incl (MM/DD/YY)> -> [<filename>.md](<filename>.md)
```

One line, no `- See` second line. The headline carries the gist; the pointer goes to the topic file that holds the full detail. (The conveyor in Phase 4 will normalize spacing/length and age out the oldest non-pinned entries, so don't fuss over exact byte length — just keep it to one line and make the pin call.)

### Knowledge layer updates

If a **knowledgeGraph from your settings** is configured, that folder is the wikilinked knowledge graph over the repo (see its own `CLAUDE.md` for the full spec). It must **compound** — every session that surfaces a new entity or materially updates one feeds it. For each "thing learned this session," also check:

- **New or materially-changed person, company, concept, playbook, project, tool, or decision?**
  → Create or update the matching note in the right subfolder of the knowledgeGraph folder, following its
  `CLAUDE.md` frontmatter spec (`type`, `created`, `tags`, `related`, `source`).
- **Dedup first** — search the knowledgeGraph folder for an existing note on the entity; prefer updating it
  over creating a near-duplicate (same anti-rot rule as memory).
- **Link it** — add `[[wikilinks]]` to related knowledge notes and a `source:` provenance path
  back to the repo/memory file the update came from. No fabrication — every claim traces to `source:`.
- This is in-repo (unlike memory), so these files DO get committed in Phase 7.

Skip this entire step if no knowledgeGraph is configured, or if the session was purely operational and surfaced no new durable entities — don't force it.

## Phase 3.5: Regenerate registries from truth

So the root-level registries never drift from reality, refresh them every close. Refresh ONLY the files named in the **registries from your settings**; check each one exists first, and skip any that aren't configured. The per-registry instructions below apply to whichever of those files you actually have.

**`SKILLS.md` — full regenerate (if it's in your registries).** Glob `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`. For each, parse the frontmatter `name` + `description` and rewrite that skill's block: `## /<name>`, **Status** `[live]`, **Purpose** (the first sentence of the description), **Invoke when** (the trigger phrases from the "Use when…" part of the description). Rewrite the custom-skill blocks from the live set — don't append — so deleted skills drop out and new ones appear. Keep the top header and group by the same categories already in the file. **PRESERVE, do not regenerate or delete, the hand-maintained sections named in the registryPreserveSections from your settings** — they document plugin + built-in tools that are NOT in `.claude/skills/`, so a frontmatter regenerate would wrongly wipe them. If a plugin was installed or removed this session, update those preserved sections' facts by hand. So: regenerate the custom-skill blocks from disk truth, preserve the registryPreserveSections blocks.

**Reflect new skills AND cross-skill integrations.** Any skill added or removed this session MUST be picked up (regenerating from the live `.claude/skills/` dir is what guarantees this). Beyond the per-skill block, capture how skills connect: where one skill calls, feeds, or draws from another, say so on BOTH entries so the integration is discoverable from either side. Never leave an integration documented on only one side. When a session explicitly wires skill A into skill B, that wiring belongs in SKILLS.md, not just in the skills' own files.

**`CONNECTIONS.md` — reconcile § 1, preserve the rest (if it's in your registries).** Run `claude mcp list`. Reconcile the § Tier-1 / Tier-2 **Status** column against what's actually connected; flag any drift (a row marked Active whose MCP isn't listed, or a live MCP with no row). Do NOT clobber the curated sections — only refresh the connected-status truth. If a new tool was connected this session, add its row and remind the user to capture its key per `references/operating/api-keys.md` (or your repo's equivalent).

**`TIME-SAVED.md` — recompute totals (if it's in your registries).** For each of the tracked time-saver rows, recompute `Total saved = Total uses × Manual time per use` and confirm `Last used` reflects any invocation this session. Only the tracked time-saver skills have rows; deep-dives and setup tools are exempt — never add rows for them. If `TIME-SAVED.md` doesn't exist yet, skip (it's created out-of-band, not by this skill).

## Phase 4: Memory conveyor — automatic, no prompt (EVERY run)

Memory is a cache, not a vault. `MEMORY.md` is the always-loaded index, but Claude Code only loads the first **200 lines OR 25KB, whichever comes first**. The index can bloat without active management. Now it's kept under a 24KB safety budget by a **conveyor**: pinned entries stay, fresh entries ride newest-first, and the oldest non-pinned overflow ages out into a dated `ARCHIVE-YYYY-MM.md` (same folder, NOT auto-loaded — a deliberate non-CLAUDE.md filename so it never reloads the bloat). **Nothing is ever deleted, so nothing needs the user's approval.**

After writing this session's new entries (Phase 3), run the conveyor once — using the **conveyorScript from your settings**. **First check the configured script actually exists on disk; only run it if it does.** If no conveyorScript is configured or the file is missing, fall back to manual hygiene: trim the index to one line per entry, keep it under the load budget by hand, and note in the close-out that the automatic conveyor wasn't available.

```bash
node <conveyorScript> --enforce
```

It normalizes entries to one line, re-detects `[PIN]` / fresh / dead-marker (CORRECTION/PRUNED/DEPRECATED) classification, moves overflow + dead-marked entries into the dated archive (**topic files stay on disk untouched**), verifies conservation (every note still lives in MEMORY ∪ archive), atomically rewrites `MEMORY.md`, and prints a one-line receipt.

**This runs silently — no AskUserQuestion, no "prune now or defer."** The only thing that ever stops it is a hard failure:

- If the script exits non-zero (a conservation check failed), it has **written nothing** — MEMORY.md is untouched. Surface the one-line error in the close-out receipt and leave memory as-is. Do NOT hand-edit to "fix" it; flag it for the user. (Rollback master, if ever needed: the byte-for-byte snapshots in `memory/_snapshots/`.)
- That is the whole gate. There is no other.

Fold the receipt into the Phase 8 "what I filed" block (e.g. "Memory: 4 new notes, kept N loading, aged M older ones into this month's archive — nothing deleted").

**Consolidation still matters, but it lives in Phase 3, not here.** The conveyor handles SIZE (bytes under budget); the Phase 3 dedup-before-write rule handles COUNT (fold two entries on the same person/project into one current entry instead of adding a near-duplicate). Keeping the entry count down is what keeps the conveyor from aging out useful notes too fast.

**To inspect without changing anything (when the conveyorScript exists):** `node <conveyorScript> --analyze` (read-only report of entries + the load cliff) or `--verify` (confirm MEMORY + archive still cover every note vs the latest `_snapshots/` baseline).

## Phase 5: Write RESUME briefing

Write `.claude/last-session.md` (committed to the repo so it's in git history, even though the next session will read it directly from disk):

```markdown
# Last session — YYYY-MM-DD, HH:MM <tz> (machine: <hostname>)

## What we just did
<3-5 bullets, synthesized from conversation + git diff>

## In flight (per project)
- **<project path>:** <status one-liner + next concrete step>
- (one bullet per project touched)

## Do this first next session
<the single most-pressing thing — be specific>

## Open blockers
<bullets, or "none">

## Files left dirty (uncommitted on purpose)
<list, or "none">

## Watchlist
<pending replies, scheduled tasks, expiring tokens, follow-ups that don't have a clear owner yet>
```

Match the briefing length to the session. A 30-minute session doesn't need a 10-bullet RESUME.

## Phase 6: Update sentinel

Write `.claude/.session-state.json`:

```json
{
  "last_run_at": "<ISO 8601 UTC of when Phase 1 started>",
  "last_run_commit": "<HEAD hash captured at the START of Phase 1>",
  "last_run_machine": "<hostname>"
}```

Why the start-of-run hash and not the post-commit hash: the sentinel records what state was *processed*, so the next `/end-session` run knows what to diff against. The commit this skill creates is part of "what's new since the sentinel," which is exactly right.

## Phase 7: Commit + push

Stage SPECIFIC files only (NEVER `git add -A` or `git add .` — root CLAUDE.md security rule):

- Each folder CLAUDE.md you updated in Phase 3
- Root CLAUDE.md (only if root-level behavioral rules were edited — the folder tree is NOT here anymore)
- The folderLayoutDoc from your settings — only if it's configured AND the folder tree changed
- Each registry from your settings that Phase 3.5 changed
- Any new or updated notes under the knowledgeGraph from your settings — the knowledge-layer compounding from Phase 3, only if a knowledgeGraph is configured
- `.claude/last-session.md`
- `.claude/.session-state.json`
- Any other files explicitly worked on this session that aren't on the do-not-commit list (CSVs with PII, `.env`, `.claude.json`, real passwords — see root CLAUDE.md security section)

**Memory files are NOT in this commit.** Memory entries live in the auto-memory folder you discovered in Phase 0 (under the user's home `~/.claude/projects/…`) — that path is OUTSIDE the repo. Git can't stage them. They're written to disk during Phase 3 and that's where they live. Don't try to add them to this commit.

Commit message:

```
chore(session): YYYY-MM-DD - <one-line summary>

- N folder CLAUDE.md updated
- M memory notes added, J aged into archive by the conveyor (none deleted)
- registries refreshed (the registries from your settings, as applicable)
- RESUME briefing refreshed
```

Pass via HEREDOC per the repo commit conventions.

Push to the default branch you detected in Phase 0: `git push origin <default-branch>` (don't hardcode `main`). On failure, AskUserQuestion for manual recovery:

- "Try `git pull --rebase` then push again (Recommended if push failed due to non-fast-forward)"
- "Defer push — leave the commit local for now"
- "Abort"

NEVER auto-resolve. NEVER force-push without explicit per-incident approval.

## Phase 8: Plain-English close-out — two receipts

This is the moment the user sees their whole day at a glance, so deliver it in a tight, plain-CEO-English receipt voice: lead with the answer, no jargon, one short line per action, any failure or skip on its own line. No wall of text.

Print TWO receipts, in order (terminal output, no AskUserQuestion). The first is the one that's easy to forget and the one the user actually cares about most: **what the session was worth.**

**Receipt 1 — What we got done this session.** The actual work, reconstructed from the conversation AND the git diff — not just the housekeeping. One plain line per real thing accomplished, with where it lives or its status. Anything involving money, anything sent out, and anything still owed gets its own clearly-flagged line. Match the length to the session: a 30-minute session is a few lines, not twenty.

```
Here's everything we got done today:
- <real accomplishment>: <where it lives / status>
- <real accomplishment>: <where it lives / status>
- Still open: <anything left unfinished, on its own line>
```

**Receipt 2 — What I filed away (what /end-session itself did).** The close-out housekeeping, so the user can see the secretary did the job rather than just trust it. Translate the jargon: "backed up to the cloud," not "pushed"; "next-session briefing," not "RESUME .md."

```
And here's what I filed so nothing's lost:
- Updated N folder notes: <list>
- Memory: M new notes, kept K loading, aged J older ones into this month's archive (nothing deleted)
- Registries refreshed: <the registries from your settings that changed, as applicable, or "none kept here">
- Next-session briefing saved: .claude/last-session.md
- Backed up to the cloud: <commit short hash>   (or "saved on your computer, cloud backup still open" if the push didn't run)
```

Don't ask "anything else?" — the user is stopping. Close out cleanly.

## Failure modes

- **No changes detected since last run:** print "Nothing to write since last /end-session run on `<date>`. Have a good break." Don't commit. Skip Phases 3-7.
- **Mid-run interruption:** all writes are atomic per file. Sentinel only updates after successful commit. Rerun is safe — pick up where you left off.
- **`--dry-run` flag passed:** log everything you would do, write nothing. Useful for verifying the skill before letting it run for real.
- **Push or pull conflict:** halt, surface the exact error, AskUserQuestion for manual recovery. Never auto-rebase, never force-push.
- **No conversation context (e.g., 5-min session):** still detect git changes and write the RESUME if anything was touched. For memory, just skip if there's nothing classifier-worthy. The skill should be useful even on tiny sessions.
- **MEMORY.md or root CLAUDE.md unreadable:** halt, surface the error, ask the user to investigate. Don't try to recover with partial data.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Don't ask the user what to write down.** That's the whole point of this skill. Detect from git + conversation. If you're tempted to ask "what did we work on?" — go re-read the transcript and the diff.
- **Don't commit do-not-commit files.** CSVs (PII), `.env`, `.claude.json`, real passwords. See root CLAUDE.md security section. Stage explicitly, never `add -A`.
- **Don't dump every detail to memory.** Apply the classifier ruthlessly. Today's task → RESUME briefing. Code patterns / file paths / git history → skip entirely. New rule from a correction → memory.
- **Don't write a 10-bullet RESUME for a 3-bullet session.** Match the length to the session.
- **Don't skip the dedup check.** Updating an existing memory entry is almost always better than adding a new one. Memory rot is mostly accretion, not absence.
- **Don't auto-rebase or force-push.** On any conflict, halt and ask.
- **Don't run /end-session mid-task.** This skill is for closing OUT a session.

## When NOT to invoke this skill

- Mid-task — the user is still working. /end-session is for closing out, not summarizing in the middle.
- "Save this for later" / "remember this" — those go directly to memory via the existing memory rules, not via /end-session.
- "Commit these changes" — that's a regular commit, not the full ritual. /end-session does its own commit at the end of the closing flow.
- A pure read-only session where nothing was changed AND nothing was learned — there's nothing to write, no need to invoke.

## Self-ping (do this at the end of every invocation)

If a `TIME-SAVED.md` registry is in the **registries from your settings** and it exists on disk, update the `/end-session` row in it:

- Increment "Total uses" by 1
- Recompute "Total saved (cumulative)" as `Total uses × 5 min`
- Update "Last used" to today's date

Skip silently if no such registry is tracked.
