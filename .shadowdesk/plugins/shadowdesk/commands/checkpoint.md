Read the full workflow at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/checkpoint/SKILL.md` and execute it exactly. Any sub-files the skill references live under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/checkpoint/`. Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as an optional note about what this checkpoint is for (used in the commit message summary and the RESUME briefing).
