# handoff

*Provided as part of your ShadowDesk engagement. Not for resale or redistribution.*

Read the full workflow at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/handoff/SKILL.md` and execute it exactly. Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as the optional focus for what the next session should pick up. Any files it points to (e.g. `templates/`) live under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/handoff/` — read them by that absolute path.

Input: $ARGUMENTS
