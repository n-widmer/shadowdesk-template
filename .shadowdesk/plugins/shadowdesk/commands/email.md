## This client's wiring (read live from the persistent data folder)

The block below prints THIS client's saved wiring. Read the `skills["email"]` block for `voiceGuidePath`, `voiceDescription`, `signature`, `bannedPhrases`, and `emailTool`.

!`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/print-config.mjs" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.json"`

## Run the workflow

Read the full workflow at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/email/SKILL.md` and execute it exactly. Notes:

- Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as the recipient name or meeting context for the email.
- Use the wiring printed above — it is already loaded here, so ignore the duplicate config-read line inside that file.
- Any files it points to (e.g. `references/`) live under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/email/` — read them by that absolute path.
- Never send. Draft only.

Input: $ARGUMENTS
