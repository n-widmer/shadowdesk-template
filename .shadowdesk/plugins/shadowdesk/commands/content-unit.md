# content-unit

## This client's voice wiring (read live from the persistent data folder)

The block below prints THIS client's saved wiring. Read the `skills["content-unit"]` block for `voiceProfilePath`, `voiceDescription`, and `defaultPlatform`.

!`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/print-config.mjs" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.json"`

## Run the workflow

Read the full content-unit workflow at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/content-unit/SKILL.md` and execute it exactly, start to finish. Notes:

- Treat everything in `$ARGUMENTS` as the raw input to shape into one content unit.
- Use the voice wiring printed above — it is already loaded here, so ignore the duplicate config-read line inside that file.
- The workflow points to supporting files as `references/...`; read them at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/content-unit/references/` (e.g. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/content-unit/references/hook.md`).
- Never skip the Phase 7 anti-slop gate before showing the user anything.

Input: $ARGUMENTS
